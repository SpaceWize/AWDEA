/**
 * A short clip that plays on a loop.
 *
 * The back-and-forth is baked into the file: it holds the footage forward and
 * then in reverse, so the browser only ever plays forward and `loop` does the
 * rest. Reversing in JavaScript is the obvious alternative and a bad one —
 * no browser supports a negative playbackRate, so it means stepping
 * currentTime backwards by hand every frame, which stutters on exactly the
 * low-powered phones this needs to work on. The encode also drops the
 * duplicate frame at the turn and at the loop point, so neither seam hitches.
 *
 * For accessibility:
 *  - A pause control is always present. WCAG 2.2.2 requires a way to stop
 *    anything that moves automatically for more than five seconds, and this
 *    moves forever.
 *  - Under `prefers-reduced-motion` the clip does not autoplay and is not even
 *    fetched; the poster carries the section, and the control becomes Play for
 *    anyone who does want to watch it.
 *  - The wrapper carries role="img" with descriptive alt text and the <video>
 *    is hidden from the accessibility tree, so a screen reader announces one
 *    image rather than a media player it cannot operate.
 *  - Playback pauses when the clip scrolls out of view, which saves battery
 *    and stops phones decoding video nobody is looking at.
